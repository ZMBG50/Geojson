# Number of Households by Postcodes (2021)

This is a basic project using Pandas and Geopandas to create a spatial visual using Matplotlib.

I found the data at https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/sources/census_2021_pc. I find using postcode data is the easiest and cleanest way to present geography data within the UK. There are so many different authority classes its a real pain to line them all up together!
You can tell there hasn't been a modern revolution in the UK with this amount of administrative bagagge. Therefore, I am relying on postcode data that has been grouped into postcode area.

Below you'll find the code in VS along with the output.

I will be on the lookout for more interesting datasets and shapefiles for more interesting projects in the future. Any shapefiles and datasets will be shared here. Stay tuned!
